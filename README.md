# Task 12: Log Monitoring & Analysis

## What is a log?
A log is a record of events generated by a system, such as login attempts,
errors, and system activities.

## Why logs are important?
Logs help in monitoring systems and detecting security incidents like
unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.

## Types of logs
- Authentication logs
- System logs
- Application logs
- Security logs

## What is SIEM?
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is used to collect and
analyze logs from different systems to detect threats.

## Example of log analysis
If multiple failed login attempts are seen from the same IP address,
it may indicate a brute-force attack.

## Conclusion
Log monitoring helps in early detection of security incidents and improves
overall system security.
